* Conways Law - Orgs will produce system designs that are copies of the communication structures of those orgs.
* Org design is about designing for collaborative tech for the voice of the customer.

## Part 1 - Teams as the means of delivery
### The problem with org charts
* Org charts don't help us understand what the actual patterns of comms in our org are. Instead, orgs need to develop more realistic pictures of the expected and actual comms happening between individuals and teams.
* Systems thinking focuses on optimizing for the whole, looking atthe overall flow of work, identifying what the largest bottleneck is today and eliminating it. Then repeat.
* This might not be your largest bottleneck today, but eventually you will face the issue of rigid team structures with poor comm or inadequate processes, slowing down delivery.
* In practice, people comm horizontally with people from other reporting lines in order to get work done. This needs to be nurtured, not restricted to optimize for top-down/bottom-up comms and reporting.
* **An org chart is always out of sync with reality.**
* Instead, we can use 3 different org structures.
  1. Org chart - facilitates compliance.
  2. Informal structure - "realm of influence" between individuals.
  3. Value creation structure - how work actually gets done based on inter-team reputation.
* Key to successful orgs is in the interactions between people and teams.
* Team topologies (TT) approach adds the dynamic and sensing aspects required for tech orgs that are missing from traditional org design.
* TT provides 4 team types (stream-aligned, platform, enabling and complicated subsystem) and 3 team interaction modes (collaboration, x-as-a-service, and facilitating).
* **Periods of product discovery required a highly collaborative env but keeping the same structure once discovery is over can lead to wasted effort and misunderstandings.**
* **Team structures must match the required software architecture or risk producing unintended designs.**
* Thinking of sw architecutre as a standalone concept that can be designed in isolation and then be implemented by any groups of teams is wrong.
* When cognitive load isn't considered, teams are spread think trying to cover an excessive amount of responsibilities and domains. Such a team lacks bandwidth to pursue mastery of their trade and struggles with the costs of switching contexts.
* Obstacles to fast flow
  * Pushing against Conways law.
  * Software too big for teams.
  * Confusing org design options.
  * Team pulled in too many directions.
  * Painful re-org often.
  * Too many surprises.
  * Disengaged teams.

### Conways Law and why it matters
* If the architecture of the system and the architecture of the org are at odds, the architecture of the org wins.
* An org arranged in functional silos (e.g., QA, DBA) is unlikely to producer software systems well-architected for e2e flow.
* **Communication paths effectively restrict the kinds of solutions that the org can devise.**
* Inverse conway maneuver - orgs should evolve their team to achive their desired architecture. The goal should be to support the ability of your team to get work done - from design to dev - without requiring high-bandwidth comms bet teams.
* Team assignments are the first draft of the architecture.
* Keeping things decoupled and team-scoped should be a key bec real gains in perf can often be achieved by adopting designs that adhere to a disaggregated model. The perf gains are due to the increased rate of flow of change and also due to the orgs ability to change the architecture to suit new contexts.
* **Anyone who makes decisions about the shape and placement of teams is strongly influencing the software architecture.**
* Org design and sw design are 2 sides of the same coin - both need to be undertaken by the same people.
* We don't need more comms bet teams but more focused comms between specific teams.
* Managers should look on understanding unpredicted team interactions across modular systems and addressing the cause.
* If everyone is communicating with everyone then we have an org design problem - this will tend to produce highly coupled, interdependent systems that do not support fast flow.
* Reorgs for the sake of management convenience is destructive, esp if they ignore conways law, team cognitive load and related dynamics/flow risk.
* Collab is needed during discovery but less important during execution phase.

### Team-first thinking
* Research by Google found that who is on the team matters less than the team dynamics and that when it comes to measuring perf, teams matter more than individuals.
* Allowing team to grow to beyond nine people imperils the viability of the sw being built by that team because trust will begin to break down and unsuitable decisions will ensue.
* **When delivering changes rapidly, it is important to ensure high trust is explicitly valued and designed for. This is what enables a team to innovate and experiment.**
* Single team - 5 to 8 folks
* Families - groups of teams no more than 50.
* Divisions - No more than 150-500 people.
* It takes about 3 months for a new team to become effective. We need to provide stability around and within the team to allow them to reach that level.
* Tuckman model describes how teams perform.
  1. Forming - creation.
  2. Storming - working through personality differences.
  3. Norming - evolving standard ways of working together.
  4. Performing - reaching high effectiveness.
