# Chapter 1
* NVC is a process of thinking with 4 steps. Observe, feelings, needs, request.

# Chapter 2
* Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. Iâ€™ll meet you there. Rumi.
* Communicating our desires in the form of demands is a characteristic of language that blocks compassion.

# Chapter 3
* Krishnamurty remarked "Observing without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence".
* When we combine observation with evaluation, others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying. Separate the two in your mind.

# Chapter 4
* Build a larger vocabulary to express how you feel.

# Chapter 5
* "I feel .. because I" is a good way to express your needs rather than blame.
* Stage 1 : Emotional slavery. We feel ourselves responsible for the feelings of others. If others don't appear happy, we feel responsible and view them as burdens. 
* Stage 2 : We are aware of the high costs of assuming responsibility for other's. This is the obnoxious stage as we don't want to be responsible for other's feelings.
* Stage 3 : Emotional libration. We respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt or shame.
