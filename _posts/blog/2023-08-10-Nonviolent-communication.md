# Chapter 1
* NVC is a process of thinking with 4 steps. Observe, feelings, needs, request.

# Chapter 2
* Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. Iâ€™ll meet you there. Rumi.
* Communicating our desires in the form of demands is a characteristic of language that blocks compassion.

# Chapter 3
* Krishnamurty remarked "Observing without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence".
* When we combine observation with evaluation, others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying. Separate the two in your mind.

# Chapter 4
* Build a larger vocabulary to express how you feel.
