title: Founders at Work

I picked up the book "Founders at work" on the airport bookstore while I was traveling from Bangalore to Toronto and I'm glad I did. The book is a compilation of interviews between Jessica Livingston and the founders from many of the 90s-era tech startups. Reading the interviews, you feel as though you're sitting right beside the participants. It's really riveting and I've compiled a few of my learnings.

### Learnings about founders

* A lot of the founders understand each other fundamentally.
  * It seems like when cofounders have a strong bond or understand and acknowledge each others strength's and weaknesses, they're able to support each other through tough times. A lot of the interviewees also seemed aware of their shortcomings and the need to partner up with someone who fills those weaknesses.
* Prior experience.
  * Many of the founders had experience running businesses in the past.
* Founders had a great curiosity.
* Founders persevered through tough times. 

### Other Learnings

* Have the strength to follow your gut.
* It's too difficult to radically change customer behavior.
* Make sure every year there's an accomplishment you can point at.
* Simplicity is good.
* Giving seed investors "right to refusal" sucks because they can block subsequent funding rounds.
* Enterprise deals take about a yr.
