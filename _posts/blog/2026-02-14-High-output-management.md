* In principle, every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you’re responsible for.
* **Are you a node connected to a network of plugged-in people or are you floating by yourself?**
* **Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies, and I mean personally trying them, not just reading about them?** Or are you waiting for others to figure out how they can re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace?
* **A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.**

* "Indicators tend to direct your attention toward what they are monitoring."
* "If the manager is a knowledge specialist, a know-how manager, his potential for influencing “neighboring” organizations is enormous."
* Individual contributors who gather and disseminate know-how and information should also be seen as middle managers, because they exert great power within the organization.
* It is important to understand that a **manager will find himself engaging in an array of activities in order to affect output.**
* “A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. In other words, he should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest.”
* **“As can be seen from my schedule, a manager not only gathers information but is also a source of it. He must convey his knowledge to members of his own organization and to other groups he influences. Beyond relaying facts, a manager must also communicate his objectives, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are approached.”**
“It’s obvious that your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life. Other activities—conveying information, making decisions, and being a role model for your subordinates—are all governed by the base of information that you, the manager, have about the tasks, the issues, the needs, and the problems facing your organization. In short, information-gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doing it.”

“You often do things at the office designed to influence events slightly, maybe making a phone call to an associate suggesting that a decision be made in a certain way, or sending a note or a memo that shows how you see a particular situation, or making a comment during an oral presentation. In such instances you may be advocating a preferred course of action, but you are not issuing an instruction or a command. Yet you’re doing something stronger than merely conveying information. Let’s call it “nudging” because through it you nudge an individual or a meeting in the direction you would like. This is an immensely important managerial activity in which we engage all the time, and it should be carefully distinguished from decision-making that results in firm, clear directives. In reality, for every unambiguous decision we make, we probably nudge things a dozen times.
Finally, something more subtle pervades the day of all managers. While we move about, doing what we regard as our jobs, we are role models for people in our organization—our subordinates, our peers, and even our supervisors. Much has been said and written about a manager’s need to be a[…]”
**“Values and behavioral norms are simply not transmitted easily by talk or memo, but are conveyed very effectively by doing and doing visibly.”**
**“All managers need to act so that they can be seen exerting influence, but they should do so in their own way.”** Some of us feel comfortable dealing with large groups and talking about our feelings and values openly in that fashion. Others prefer working one-on-one with people in a quieter, more intellectual environment.
“ **We recognize and consciously stress the need for us to be role models for people in our organization.**
* “Meetings provide an occasion for managerial activities.”
“Managerial productivity—that is, the output of a manager per unit of time worked—can be increased in three ways:
  1. Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities, speeding up his work.
  2. Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities.
  3. Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with higher leverage.”

**HIGH-LEVERAGE ACTIVITIES can be achieved in three basic ways:**
  * When many people are affected by one manager.
  * When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of words or actions.
  * When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information.

To maximize the leverage of his activities, a manager must keep **timeliness**, which is often critical, firmly in mind.
Each time a manager imparts his knowledge, skills, or values to a group, his leverage is high, as members of the group will carry what they learn to many others.
* “The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them.”
* **Delegation without follow-through is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task.** Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result.
* “if you have a choice you should delegate those activities you know best.”
“To use quality assurance principles effectively, the manager should only go into details randomly, just enough to try to ensure that the subordinate is moving ahead satisfactorily. To check into all the details of a delegated task would be like quality assurance testing 100 percent of what manufacturing turned out.”
“To use your calendar as a production-planning tool, you must accept responsibility for two things:
1.  You should move toward the **active use of your calendar, taking the initiative to fill the holes between the time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities.**
2.  You should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.”
* **“A manager should carry a raw material inventory in terms of projects.** This inventory should consist of things you need to do but don’t need to finish right away—discretionary projects, the kind the manager can work on to increase his group’s productivity over the long term. Withuot inventory of projects, a manager will most probably use his free time meddling in his subordinates’ work.
* “But you can channel the time needed to deal with uncontrolled interruptions into organized, scheduled form by providing an alternative to interruption—a scheduled meeting or an office hour.”
* **“A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him.”**
