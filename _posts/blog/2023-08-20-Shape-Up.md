## Introduction
* Executing something the wrong way can destroy morale, grind teams down, erode trust, crunch gears and wreck the machinery of long term progress.
* We shape the work before giving it to a team. A small senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define key elements of a solution before the project is ready to bet on. Projects are defined in the right level of abstraction - concrete enough that teams know what to do but abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details by themselves.
**Appetite : Instead of "How long will this take", we ask, "How much time do we want to spend".**
* We give full responsibility to a small team of designers and programmers. This frees up Sr folks to shape up better projects.
**We don't give a project to a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.**
* If a project runs over six weeks, it doesn't get an extension.
* We integrate design and programming early.

## Part one : Shaping.
* Don't overspecify design - it stifles creativity.
* Don't make it too abstract either.
* Properties of shaped work.
* Property 1 : It's rough.
  * Work that's too fine too early commits everyone to the wrong details.
  * **Designers and programmers need room to apply their own judgement and expertise when they roll up their sleeves and discover the trade-offs that emerge.**
* Property 2 : It's solved
  * Shaped work has been thought through - the main elements of the solution are there at the macro leve and connect together.
* Property 3 : It's bounded.
  * It tells the team what not to do. There's appetite - amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project. This requires leaving specific things out.
* Who shapes - requires combining interface with tech and business priorities. You need to be a generalist or collaborate with 2 other people.
* Shaping is primarily design work. But you should be able to judge what's possible, what's easy and what's hard.
* You need to be strategic - why does it matter to implement this?
* It's a closed door, creative process.
* **Work on the shaping track is kept private and not shared with wider team until the commitment has been made to bet on it.**
* This enables shapers to drop it when it's not working out.
* Steps to shaping.
  1. Set boundaries via appetites.
    * We set appetite in 2 sizes (1) Small batch - takes 3 folks 2 weeks, or (2) Big Batch - takes 3 folks 6 weeks.
    * If it's beyond 6 weeks, we have to break the project into pieces.
    * Principle is **"Fixed time, variable scope".**
    * Responding to raw ideas : We should give new ideas space, and say "maybe". Not "yes" or "no" because we don't understand it yet.
  2. Rough out on wireframes.
  3. Address risks and rabbit holes.
  4. Write the pitch for betting table.
