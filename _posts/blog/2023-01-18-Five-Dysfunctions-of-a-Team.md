After reading The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni, I took time to reflect on my own team. While we're performing well in the many areas such as interpersonal trust, debate-then-commit and being results-driven, I realized that I need to build a culture of accountability so that our team can uphold high standards in the org.

Some of my personal action items are listed below.

* I created a standard on "How to lead projects" but haven't done enough to get the team to adhere to them. I'm planning to discuss and reiterate these standards frequently and encourage folks to call each other out when standards slip.
* It's going to be important to hold DRIs accountable for delivery against deadlines and communicate risks early so we can help address them.
* While we track project outcomes well, we need to also track process outcomes that are discussed in retrospective meetings.
