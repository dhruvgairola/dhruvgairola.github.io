title: Cryptocurrency Speculation
type: blog

My earliest recollection in the cryptocurrency space was a discussion I had with a colleague in 2012, who had described Bitcoin as an anonymous means of buying shady goods and services online (Bitcoin is not truly anonymous). Almost 6 years later, as the public interest in cryptocurrency burgeoned, I wondered what had changed. Popular media had always been critical, associating cryptocurrency with anarchy (Silk Road) and fraud (Mt Gox). All of a sudden, the average joe wanted to "invest" in Bitcoin. My aged uncle cornered me at a family party, wanting to chat about Bitcoin. A slick banker friend was excited about blockchain. It was at this point that I decided to educate myself, reading research papers and diving deep (the cryptocurrency course offered by Princeton University is excellent). 

As I conducted my research, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of sympathy for the early adopters who were now forced into a new ecosystem replete with "get-rich-quick" types, ignorant crypto-bros, scammers and despised third-parties like banks. To be fair, the early adopters weren't solely driven by a libertarian ideology. Many simply wanted to buy drugs online. In any case, many of the new entrants in the ecosystem got seriously burned when the cryptocurrency market crashed in late 2018. This seemed inevitable since there was no real basis for investing in cryptocurrency for the vast majority. As the markets crashed, I was nearing the end of my foundational education in this space. I both enjoyed reading about the nitty gritty details while also felt the urge to explore opportunities to either build products or invest in promising coins.

In this post, I want to evaluate opportunities mostly from an investment/speculation perspective i.e., if I had $100, which currencies would I buy and why? My examination is based on factors such as : the team/organization developing the currency, the use-cases or pain points addressed, the market impact in solving these pain points, the competitive advantage offered by the technology, the riskiness of the investment and the timing of the investment.

### Background

If you have some familiarity with how cryptocurrencies work, you can skip this section.
{:.hint}

I'll provide a simplified overview of how blockchains and cryptocurrencies work using Bitcoin as an example. The story begins with nodes/computers/devices which decide to install a piece of software. This software allows nodes to communicate with each other, forming a network. The software also enforces rules within the network. There are different types of nodes within this network. Fully validating nodes store the entire history of transactions that will take place by participants in the network. This ledger is called the blockchain beacause the ledger is organized as a series of blocks where each block contains many transactions. Only 1 node has the right to create a block and this right is obtained by being the first to solve a difficult, but useless, mathematical puzzle. The node which solves the puzzle first gets a mining reward (newly minted cryptocurrency). This node creates the block by adding the mining reward transaction (to itself) and also other transactions that this node "heard about" between other nodes in the network (also charging transaction fees). This node then adds the block to its own blockchain and then publishes the block to other nodes. All honest nodes have no choice but to accept this new block, as per the rules of the software that they are running. A new puzzle is generated and all mining nodes compete again to create new blocks to the blockchain.

The blockchain ledger doesn't just store transactions; it can also store smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that are executed when a set of conditions are met. When two or more nodes agree to participate in a smart contract transaction, and if the conditions of the contract are met, then tokens are exchanged between the parties. These tokens are usually cryptocurrencies which the software accepts in its network. The software accepts these tokens as long as they conform to some standard (e.g., ERC-20) and provided that they are also developed using a prescribed software development platform. The Ethereum software for example, allows a variety of tokens developed by third-parties to be accepted for use within its network in addition to its own native currency ETH. This also means that fully validating nodes which store the Ethereum blockchain have to record all transactions involving the various tokens, not just ETH. Smart contracts are created using a programming language. The Ethereum platform offers Solidity, a turing-complete language, while Bitcoin also offers a scripting language, which is a stack-based language with limited functionality. In Ethereum's case, arbitrarity complex programs (smart contracts) can be added to the blockchain and each smart contract transaction is carried out using the computing power of the the fully validating nodes. Hence, transaction fees paid by participants of an Ethereum based smart contract factors in the time it takes to execute this smart contract (gas cost) and the price per unit of time (gas price). These transaction fees are paid in ETH, no matter the tokens being exchanged.

### Payments
**Direct to Merchants/P2P**

Reading /r/cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency blogs, it seems like many readers are excited about purchasing goods online or in-store using cryptocurrency. However, it is not clear why paying with cryptocurrency would be preferable over cash or credit (leaving aside countries with hyperinflation). As a consumer, I would use cryptocurrency only if it were cheaper and easier to buy goods and services and if I also had existing conveniences like being able to access credit, reverse transactions, perform chargebacks, recover my account credentials, etc. However, for me to even access cryptocurency, I would have to either mine the currency or buy it over an exchange, which is expensive and tedious. For the vast majority, even understanding cryptocurrency is challenging, let alone accessing it or loading it into a credit card (e.g., Wirex). Managing your private keys is not intuitive for consumers.  Merchants would also have to manage volatile cryptocurrency by converting the various payments into stablecoins. Crucially, the anonymity benefits of cryptocurrency are at complete odds with regulation. Widespread adoption seems unlikely without solutions to many of these difficult problems, and even then, competing or existing solutions might outperform cryptocurrency based solutions.

> **Thought Experiment** Perhaps consumers would be more willing to use cryptocurrency daily if they had the same level of convenience that most banks offer. Consumers would open an account at our fictional bank, Acme bank. This bank would manage credentials in a centralized manner so that customers wouldn't have to manage private keys. In order to obtain Acme coins, customers would deposit fiat into their accounts, and these would be automatically be converted into Acme stablecoins (e.g., Dai) by a smart contract. These Acme coins would be available for use immediately in laptop and mobile wallets. For customers, online payments become easy using these wallets, and in-store payments can be performed via NFC phones or an Acme credit card (e.g., Wirex). The various payments-middlemen would be replaced by smart contracts. Acme ATMs would allow customers to withdraw fiat by selling Acme stablecoins. For transfers from an Acme account to an account in another bank or country, or for remittance, Acme stablecoins could be used for settlement between banks. Transactions between accounts would be held in escrow (e.g., Ethereum Safe Remote Purchase) for longer if the transactions are deemed risky (e.g., cross border transactions) by machine learning algorithms, and these transactions could be cancelled by customers if needed. Acme bank would have to be compliant with the financial laws in the countries it operates. This also means that Acme bank could freeze your funds if deemed necessary. Acme bank would offer interest to customers, similar to how holding coins accumulates dividends (like Neo and Gas). For all intents and purposes, Acme would function like a regular bank, except that many of its operations would be performed on the blockchain.

**Indirect via Intermediaries**

Instead of paying for goods and services using cryptocurrency in a peer-to-peer setting, a more realistic scenario is for cryptocurrency to "play nice" with existing financial institutions. Already, banks are exploring blockchain based technology and even issuing their own "cryptocurrencies" (e.g., Goldman Sachs) to "improve various business operations". While this is probably more marketing speak than actual advancement, we should consider how cryptocurrency could be applied to improve payments in the B2B setting. Typically, the payments ecosystem consists of :
  1. Issuers : These are the organizations that issue credit cards to their customers (e.g., banks, credit unions, retailers).
  2. Online and physical payment gateways : Online gateways provide APIs that your websites can use for online payments (e.g., Stripe, Paypal). Physical gateways refer to point-of-sale systems that accept credit cards (e.g., Square POS, Moneris POS).
  3. Payment processors : These processors move payments from issuers to merchant banks. Processors are usually banks (called merchant/acquiring banks) but can also be ISOs which are third-parties contracted by banks for payment processing (e.g., Stripe, Square, Moneris).
  4. Payment networks : These allow communication between banks within the network (e.g., Visa). Processors rely on this network in order to process payments and perform settlement.

The diagram above shows how a payment flows through the ecosystem [1] (similar diagrams can be found in [2][3]). In this system, merchants are charged around 3% by the third-parties. Of the 3%, majority of the fees are paid to the issuing bank, and smaller fees are paid to the acquirers and the payment network providers. The settlement between the acquirer and issuer takes a few days. For remittance, a $500 billion market [R1], these fees can reach 7%, and settlement is even longer [tapscott, 48]. For international payments, there is an additional issue where banks have to hold foreign currency in foreign accounts to mitigate exchange rate risk. This has an opportunity cost because the foreign currency is sitting idle in those foreign accounts. Can cryptocurrency solve some of these payment-related problems?

A company called Ripple promises solutions for speedier settlements via one of its products, called xRapid.

> xRapid : "International payments, especially in emerging markets, require businesses to hold pre-funded accounts in destination currencies. It’s a costly endeavor that ties up resources. RippleNet provides an alternative. Customers have the option to source liquidity required for cross-border payments with XRP and enable instant payments to and from any country in the world." [4]

The idea is for banks to buy XRP coins when they need it and send the XRP to other banks in the Ripple network for cross-border settlements. However, banks would not actually want to hold XRP coins for too long because XRP is very volatile and banks, being heavily regulated, cannot take such a high risk. If banks don't buy and hold XRP coins, then its unclear how regular folk (non-traders) could profit by holding XRP long term. Similar points can be made against competitors like Stellar.

Ripple also has products like xCurrent and xVia, which allow the various players in the ecosystem to move money more efficiently and for cheaper. However, xCurrent and xVia do not use XRP. Thus, investing in Ripple (the company) makes more sense than buying the XRP, but that is a separate discussion involving comparisons with encumbent competitors like SWIFT. Useful articles about Ripple can be found online [5][6].

### Platforms
**Prelude**

Platforms like Ethereum have unlocked human creativity on the blockchain. Developers have implemented various tokens and smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. The basic building block (pardon the pun) of the blockchain, smart contracts, can enforce contracts programmatically thus invalidating the need for trusted middlemen. When pretty web or mobile interfaces are layered on top of smart contracts, these become dApps or distributed applications (e.g., Cryptokitties). In most dApps, only a small amount of business logic is on the blockchain; most of the business logic is confined to the organization that sells the app. When the organization decides to move the majority of its business logic to the blockchain, it becomes a DAO, or a distributed autonomous organization.

Before examining specific use cases, we must note how the various tokens on a platform and the native currency interact. Using Ethereum as an example, when a company issues new tokens, buyers use ETH coins to purchase them. When smart contracts are executed, the transaction fees are also paid in ETH irrespective of the token. So if a token is wildy successful, there might be a mild impact on the price of ETH via these direct interactions. However, the price correlation beteween ETH and a token is a lot more complex, so for simplicity's sake it's probably better to examine ETH independently from a token.
