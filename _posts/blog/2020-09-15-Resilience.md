My company had a lecture about Resilience by Dr. Michael Unger, and I have compiled a few of my notes below.

* Resilience - nagivate your world but also negotiate resources around you.
* Resilience is not just about being positive yourself but also about the resources/support around you. 
* Factors such as accountability, supportive relationships, community belonging, sense of control, positive thinking, physical and financial well being (social comparison causes unhappy financial wellbeing).
* Which resources we need is a matter of negotiation.
* Strategies for success :
  * Change yourself - which change are the right ones?
    * Chocolate.
    * Sleep.
    * Physical fitness.
    * Dinner with family.
    * A little alcohol.
    * Relationships/Sex.
  * Make the best use possible of the 12 resources you have.
  * Change your world to have more of the 12 resources.
  * When all else fails, change what you want.
