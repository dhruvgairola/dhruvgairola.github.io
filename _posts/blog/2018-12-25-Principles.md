Here is my summary of the book Priciples by Ray Dalio.

### Introduction
* #1 What do you want. #2 What is true. #3 What are you going to do about it?
* Key to success lies in striving for a lot and learning from failures.
* To be a successful entrepreneur, one has to be an independent thinker who correctly bets against the consensus, which means being painfully wrong a fair amount.
* Write down your system for decision making.

### Part 1
**Chapter 1**
* Great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because at least terrible gives life flavor.

**Chapter 2**
* When everybody thinks the same thing, it is almost certainly reflected in the price, and betting on it is probably going to be a mistake.
* There are always risks out there that can hurt you badly, so it's best to assume you're missing something.
* Making money should not be your goal because money has no intrinsic value- its value comes from what it can buy, and it can't buy everything. **It's smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them.**
* Meaningful work and meaningful relationships were are still are my primary goals and everything I did was for them.

**Chapter 3**
* I had to change my mindset from "I'm right" to "How do I know I'm right". This was done by finding other independent thinkerswho are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me.
* Acknowledge and embrace your weaknesses.
* To do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that, if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think you have failed- but that won't be true unless you give up.

**Chapter 4**
* Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.
* All organizations basically have 2 types of people : those who work to be part of a mission and those who work for a paycheck.
* Having a few good uncorrlated return streams is better than having just one, and knowing how to combine return streams is even more effective than being able to choose good ones (though of course you have to do both).
* Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside.
* **There is almost always a good path that you just haven't figured out yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you.**
* Work principles :
  1. Put our honest thoughts out on the table.
  2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn.
  3. Have agreed-upon ways to deciding if disagreements remain so we can continue beyond them without resentments.

**Chapter 5**
* Hire, train, test and then fire or promote quickly, so that we could rapidly identify the excellent hires and get rid of the ordinary ones.
* Joining Bridgewater is like joining an intellectual Navy SEALS. The people who thrive say that while the period of adjustment is difficult, it is also joyous because of the excellence they achieve and the extraordinary relationships they make. And the ones who can't or won't adapt must be cut; this is essential to keeping Bridgewater excellent.

**Chapter 6**
* A shaper is someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts and opposition of others.
* Shapers can see both the big picture and the granular details. They are very resilient.
* Heroes inevitably experience at least one very big failure that tests whether they have the resilience to come back and fight smarter and with more determination.

**Chapter 7**

**Chapter 8**
* I cannot say that having an intense life filled with accomplishments is better than having a relaxed life filled with savoring.
* **The happiest people discover their own nature and match their life to it.** 

### Life Principles
1. Embrace reality and deal with it.
    * Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life
    * Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change.
    * Don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.
    * Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will miss out on learning how they really are.
    * Evolve or die.
    * Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable.
    * In order to gain strength, one has to push one's limits, which is painful. If you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential.
    * There are a whole host of ways that something will get you. At such times, you will be in pain and might think that you don't have the strength to go on. You almost always do, however; your ultimate success will depend on you realizing that fact, even though it might not seem that way at the moment.
    * **You will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being beyond your control.**
    * Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine (an algorithm to reach your goal) and you as a worker with your machine. This way, when you compare your outcome with your goal, you can tweak the design of your machine. If you're just a worker in your machine, you're only living in the moment and not reflecting.
    * When encountering your weaknesses, you have 4 choices :
        1. Deny them.
        2. Accept them and work on them.
        3. Accept them and find ways around them.
        4. Change what you are going after.
    * **Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you** is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing.
    * **If you are open-minded enough and determined, you can get virtually anything you want.**
    * Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.
    * Face the harsh realities.
2. Personal evolutionary process takes place in 5 steps :
    1. Have clear goals.
        * Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable. Be audacious. There is always a best possible path.
        * If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are seting the bar too low.
    2. Identify and don't tolerate problems that stand in the way of achieving these goals.
    3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get to their root causes.
    4. Design plans that will get you around them.
        * Be granular with your plans and make sure progress is measurable.
        * It doesn't take a lot of time to design a good plan.
    5. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.
        * Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in their way of success. Find yours and deal with it.
3. Be Radically Open-Minded
    * The two biggest barriers to good decision making are your ego and your blind spots.
    * Radical open-mindedness allows you to escape from the control of your lower-level (emotional) you and ensures that your upper-level (logical) you sees and considers all the good choices and makes the best possible decisions.
    * Don't worry about looking good; worry about achieving your goal.
    * If one person is clearly more knowledgeable than the other, it is preferable for the less knowledgeable person to approach the more knowledgeable one as a student. Believable people are those who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the think in question and have great explanations of their approach when probed.
    * Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree.
    * Be evidence based and encourage others to be the same.
