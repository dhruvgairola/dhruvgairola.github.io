title: When Your Employee Feels Angry, Sad, or Dejected
type: blog
---
In the past, I have found it tricky figuring out how to respond when a report feels dejected or angry. I want to be careful not to overstep but would love to help if possible. I remember asking an older manager for advice and the response was to acknowledge and direct them to existing processes. When I recently read an [article](https://hbr.org/2024/07/when-your-employee-feels-angry-sad-or-dejected), I got a better understanding of how other managers respond when their reports are going through a difficult time in their lives.

The article explains that the best leaders react to people's emotions in ways that support their goals (e.g., to perform well, to feel valued, etc). They also know when to simply acknowledge employeesâ€™ feelings, when to give advice, and when to provide employees with the space and time to handle their emotions privately. I wanted to share an insightful framework that they proposed to help managers support their employees. I personally feel that this framework offers a more nuanced approach to guiding reports through difficult circumstances.
