title: My Favorite Sci-Fi Books
type: lists
---

In the past 3-4 years, I've taken a special interest in reading Sci-Fi books. My favourite books typically involve strange new planets, creatures, societies, technology and often have mind-bending plots. In my list, I have chosen not to focus on classics like 1984, Brave New World, etc. I have also excluded fantasy novels (e.g., LOTR, Harry Potter).
