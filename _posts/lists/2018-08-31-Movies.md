### 3. The Godfather Part 2
Godfather 2 is probably the greatest movie sequel ever made with outstanding performances by Al Pachino and Robert De Niro.

### 2. The Godfather
One of my favorite sequences from the movie is when Michael Corleone is at a baptism ceremony while having orchestrated the demise of various rivals at the very same moment. The Godfather is a masterpiece. The film features some of the finest acting I've ever seen. The story, setting, soundtrack- everything feels authentic.

### 1. The Matrix
I didn't really understand the storyline of The Matrix when I first watched it, but I fell in love with the cyberpunk setting of the film. Rewatching it a few times, even the story was really unique. The machines had subdued humans and plugged our consciousness into a computer generated world called The Matrix. It was prophesized that Neo would free mankind from their enslavement. What ensues is a mind-bending journey through the eyes of Neo as he jumps across buildings and dodges bullets in slow motion.
