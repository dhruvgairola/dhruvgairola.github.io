I've compiled a list of my favorite video games here.

### 1. Pokemon Red/Blue
My first gameboy cartridge was a bootleg Pokemon Yellow that my dad found in some shady store in Singapore. The cartridge was a piece of junk because any game progress could not be saved. I had to convince one of my rich friends to loan me his **original**, non-bootleg Pokemon Blue cartridge. It was love at first sight (or rather at first save). Still in primary school, I was obsessed with trying to collect all 150 Pokemon. I wanted to be a real life pokemon trainer. I remember playing the gameboy at recess, in the bus, battling with my pokemon obsessed friends, trading pokemon. It was a cultural phenomenon at the time. Trading cards, cartoons, toys, an entire industry built on pokemon. Fast forward even 15 years later, the pokemon franchise still holds strong, a testament to the game that started it all.

### 2. Half Life 2
When half life 2 came out in 1998, my cousin was one of the first ones to buy it. I was surprised one day when he called me over to watch him play (how generous). Half life 2 terrified me, probably because my cousin was playing the Ravenholme chapter when I was invited. Still, I wanted to see the game through. Many years later, I played the game first hand and enjoyed it doubly so. Even then, it was far superior to other fps games. The story, characters, the level design, the environment, the puzzles, object interactions, half life 2 is truly one of the greatest games ever made.

### 3. DoTA 1/2
I played dota 1 when it was a custom map in Warcraft 3. Lan gaming centers everywhere were flooded with dota players, and even though I embarassed myself playing against regulars, I never stopped playing dota. Dota is the most complex game I've ever played. The premise is simple. 5v5 heroes, and the objective is to destroy all enemy towers. But even 15 years in, I'm still amazed at the new strategies and interactions that pros exploit in multi-million dollar tournaments. It's difficult to describe the complexity of dota to newbies. In my estimation, it takes a few thousand game hours to get a basic understanding and appreciation of dota as an inherently strategic game.

### 4. Counter Strike 1.6
A favorite in lan gaming centers in Singapore, CS 1.6 was the go-to game in my early teens. Extremely enjoyable, the game rewards players who posses great reflexes and hand-eye coordination.

### 5. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic (Kotor)
One of my favorite twists is revealed in kotor, a beautifully designed masterpiece of a game, with an amazing cast, gameplay and an enthralling storyline. 

### 6. Half Life 1
I played half life 1 way too late when I was already in my late teens. In fact, I played it after completing half life 2. However, this game deserves a place on any list of greatest games.

### 7. Sims 1
### 8. GTA San Adreas
### 9. Age of Empires 2
### 10. Quake 3 Arena
