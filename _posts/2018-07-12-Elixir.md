title: Introduction to Elixir
---

I'm currently learning Elixir and this post represents some of my learnings from the Elixir guide.

### Introduction
* iex : Interactive Elixir.
* An atom is a constant whose name is its own value.
* The booleans true and false are, in fact, atoms.
* Anonymous functions can be created inline and are delimited by the keywords fn and end.
```
iex> add = fn a, b -> a + b end
```
* Functions are “first class citizens” in Elixir meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions in the same way as integers and strings.
