title: Intelligent Investor

The current cryptocurrency craze inspired me to re-read the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. I've compiled a list of my learnings, and will keep adding chapters as I read them.

**Commentary on the introduction**
* Intelligent investor : Being patient, disciplined and eager to learn. Harness your emotions and think for yourself.
* Don't let the roar of the crowd override your own judgement.
* Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.
* People who now claim the next "sure thing" are no more likely to be right in the end that the hypesters of high tech turned out to be in the dot com bust.

**Chapter 1 : Investment vs Speculation**
* An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and adequate return. Anything else is speculation.
* There is a speculative componenet inherent in most common stocks.
* Speculation is unintelligent when :
   * You are speculating when you think you're investing.
   * Speculating seriously when you lack the skill.
   * Risking more money than you can afford to lose.
* Never mingle your speculative and investment operations in the same account nor in any part of your thinking.
* A margin accoung enables you to buy stocks using money you borrow from the brokerage firm. The collateral for the loan is the value of the investments in your account.
* Results to be expected by the defensive investor :
  * (6 years ago) 25-75% bonds and converse for stock holdings.
* Results to be expected by the aggressive investor :
  * Follow policies which are (1) Inherently sound and promising and (2) Not popular on Wall Street.
  * Buying a neglected and undervalued issue is a protracted and patience trying experience.
  * Profiting by shorting stocks is a difficult art to master.

 **Commentary on Chapter 1**
 * For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes is like oxygen- cut it off and he dies.
 * For an investor, Graham urges you to invest even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.
 * People who invest make money for themselves; people who speculate make money for their brokers.
 * The intelligent investor has no interest in being temporarily right. To reach your long-term financial goals, you must be sustainable and reliably right.
 * Mainstream media turned the stock market into a video game. Everyone was day trading.
 * In the late 1990s, a half-baked opinion on price could double a compay's stock even as its value went entirely unexamined.
 * Trendy formulas that fell flat :
   * January effect : Buy small stocks at the end of Dec and sell then in Jan, you can beat the market by 5-10%. It worked at first but publicizing this made the effect smaller.
   * Do 'what works' : Follow O'shaughnessy's strategy by buying 50 stocks with the highest 1-year returns, 5 straight years of rising earnings, and share prices less than 1.5x of revenues.
   * The foolish four : Motley fool said (1) Take 5 stocks from DJIA with lowest stock prices and highest divident yields (2) Discard the one with the lowest price (3) Put 40% of your cash in the stock with the 2nd-lowest price (4) Put 20% on the rest (5) Do the same every year (6) Repeat till wealthy. None of the points meet Graham's definition of an investment (too risky, not diversified, no analysis at all).
* If you look at enough data, a lot of patterns emerge, if only by luck. Unless these factors cause the stocks to outperform, they can't be used to predict future returns i.e., coorelation is not causation.
* The intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as a mad money acoount for gambling.
* The gambling instinct is part of human nature- confine and restrain it.
* Don't ever confuse speculation with investment.
