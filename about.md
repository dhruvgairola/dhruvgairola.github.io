**Experience**

I started my career building games as an Android app developer. Soon after, I transitioned to backend web development (JRuby stack). After my masters studies, I started my own firm, delving deep into distributed systems development. I created an enterprise platform to empower business analysts to work with big-data. Currently, I work as an e-commerce developer building complex distributed systems.

**Education**

I completed my MSc degree in Computer Science at McMaster University as a member of the [Data Science Research Lab](http://db.cas.mcmaster.ca). My thesis was titled [Data Cleaning with Minimal Information Disclosure](http://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/18075/2/gairola_dhruv_201507_msc_computer_science.pdf) and lead to [3 publications](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/g/Gairola:Dhruv) (1 ACM JDIQ Journal and 2 ACM CIKM Conference). 

Additionally, I completed my BSc degree (Hons) in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham, graduating with First Class Honours and a departmental rank of 1/55.

**Technical Interests**

Broadly, my interests include distributed systems, software architecture and algorithms. I like diving deep into problems. I am intimately familiar with Java, and Java-related technologies (Spring, Spark, Android, JRuby, etc). I also enjoy programming in Ruby, Python and Javascript.
