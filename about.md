**Experience**

I'm currently an engineering manager at Wealthsimple in our stock-trading product line. In the past, I've been in software engineering roles at both Series-B startups and large enterprises. My fondest memory is starting my own business and spending 2 years as a CTO where I hired devs, raised funds and managed on-prem relationships with customers (we built an excel-like platform for big-data).

**Education**

I completed my MSc degree in Computer Science at McMaster University as a member of the Data Science Research Lab. My thesis was titled [Data Cleaning with Minimal Information Disclosure](http://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/18075/2/gairola_dhruv_201507_msc_computer_science.pdf) and lead to [3 publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=VnJw6zIAAAAJ&hl=en) (1 ACM JDIQ Journal and 2 ACM CIKM Conferences). 

Additionally, I completed my BSc degree (Hons) in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham, graduating with First Class Honours and a departmental rank of 1/55.

**Technical Interests**

Broadly, my interests include distributed systems, software architecture and algorithms. I like diving deep into problems. I am intimately familiar with Java, and Java-related technologies (Spring, Spark, Android, JRuby, etc). I also enjoy programming in Typescript/React and Python.

**Other Interests**

* Guitar
* Swimming
* Scrabble
* Entrepreneurship
* Reading sci-fi or lit classics
