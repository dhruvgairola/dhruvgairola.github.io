I am currently pursuing an MSc degree in Computer Science at McMaster University, and am a member of the Data Science Research Lab. My research interests include data cleaning, data mining, data privacy, and databases. An avid programmer, I am intimately familiar with Java, and Java related technologies (Spring, Android, etc). In addition, I also program in Python, Ruby and R.

My hobbies include playing the guitar, drumming, playing scrabble, swimming, etc.
