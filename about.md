I completed my MSc degree in Computer Science at McMaster University as a member of the [Data Science Research Lab](http://db.cas.mcmaster.ca). My thesis was titled "Data Cleaning with Minimal Information Disclosure" (will update with the link soon). Additionally, I completed my BSc degree in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. 

My research interests include data cleaning, data mining, and databases. I am intimately familiar with Java, and Java related technologies (Spring, Android, JRuby, etc). I also enjoy programming in Python, Ruby and R.

My hobbies include playing the guitar, drumming, playing scrabble, swimming, etc.
